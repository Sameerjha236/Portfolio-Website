      About
      <p>
        <li>
          Hi there! My name is Sameer Jha and I'm a frontend developer who's
          passionate about creating awesome websites that people love to use.
          I've got a background in data science and competitive programming, so
          I'm no stranger to solving complex problems and developing creative
          solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          When I'm not busy coding, you can usually find me exploring new
          technologies and frameworks. I love learning new things and
          experimenting with different tools to find the best way to bring ideas
          to life. I'm a big fan of JavaScript and React, and I've also got
          experience with Python, C++, and more.
        </li>
        <li>
          I believe that the best way to get things done is through
          collaboration and teamwork, and I'm always excited to work with other
          developers to build amazing things. So if you're looking for a
          passionate and enthusiastic developer to join your team, look no
          further!
